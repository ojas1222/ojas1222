			<b>1.Waves :- </b>Waves was made to give people the chance to simply relax and destress.<br>
Waves is a simple but powerful meditation website that helps people with preserving mental health and capacity.<br>
Waves has many exercises for you to go through with yoga and meditation made to help the mind.<br>
Too many people suffer from mental health issues and I tell all of those people to try meditation,<br>
but most people brush it off and say that won't work for me and never try it.<br>
Waves is simple enough that anyone can use it and that was intentional.<br>
Anyone and Everyone should use waves and start or continue there path to a healthier happier life.<br>
